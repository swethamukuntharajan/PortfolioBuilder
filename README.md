# PortfolioBuilder
PortfolioBuilder
Aplication will have the following key functionalities:

User Input: Users will interact with a frontend (built with React.js) to input their professional information. This includes details like:

Personal profile (name, contact info, about me).
Professional experience (job titles, companies, descriptions, dates).
Education (degrees, institutions, graduation dates).
Skills (technical and soft skills).
Potentially projects in later phases.
Portfolio Generation: Based on the data the user enters, the application will dynamically generate a portfolio website. This involves taking the user's information and structuring it according to a predefined template or potentially offering template choices in the future.

Code Output: The crucial part you highlighted is that the user will be able to get the code of their generated portfolio. This means the application will provide the HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript files that constitute their personal portfolio website. The user can then download these files and host their portfolio on any web hosting service they choose.

In essence, the application acts as a user-friendly interface to structure and organize professional information, and then it outputs this information as a ready-to-deploy website code package
